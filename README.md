# Wahyunur Portfolio


## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# install dependencies (if you plan to use the JS build tooling)
npm install

# start a simple dev server (uses live-server as an example)
npx live-server .
```

> Any static server works. The site is fully client-side with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS assets located under `css/`, `js/`, and `images/`.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `index.html` – main landing page.
- `css/` – global styles, spacing utilities, responsive rules, and plugin CSS.
- `js/` – core interactions (animations, scroll button, sticky sidebar, chatbot).
- `images/` & `svg/` – media assets referenced across the sections.

## ✅ Deployment

The project is ready to deploy on any static host (e.g., GitHub Pages, Vercel). Upload the root folder contents or connect the repository directly to your hosting provider.

## 🧩 Localization

Many elements use `data-i18n` attributes to support multi-language content. Update the translation files or script handling these attributes to extend the available languages.
